    {
        "Alisa Bosconovitch": "Alisa is a robot created by Dr. Bosconovitch to look like his daughter, designed to serve as bodyguard of Jin Kazama.\nAlong with Lars and Lee, Alisa is shown in Tekken 7 supporting Jin as he prepares to defeat the invading Kazuya Mishima.\nOne of Alisa's biggest characteristic is her movement. Her quick backdashes and sidesteps allow her to push the limits of Tekken,\ndodging moves in situations that other characters would not be able to dodge.\nThis enables Alisa to poke and prod the opponent with her safer moves, then whiff punish the opponent as soon as they throw out a move without thinking.\nAlisa's neutral moves and optimal combos are very easy to execute, making her a good character to start with.\nHowever, Alisa does have slightly lower punish damage as well as limited combo routes to compensate.\nIf you want to enjoy Tekken's 3D fighting mechanics to the fullest, Alisa would be a great choice for you.\nAlisa's potential grows as you learn more about the game and learn how to utilize movement and sidesteps effectively.\nRecommended players: Chanel, AO, Cuddle Core",
        "Akuma / Gouki": "Coming straight from the SF universe, Gouki/Akuma is the hired hitman to bring an end to the Mishima Bloodline.\nEven after his nerfs from S2, it is true that Akuma is widely considered OP with unfair damage potential.\nHowever, his OP attributes require a steep mechanical hurdle - the reason Akuma was allowed to bend the rules of Tekken for as long as he did.\nAkuma's true potential was realized mid season 2, when multiple Pakistani Akuma players exploded onto the TWT scene.\nWhile Akuma's difficulty has even professionals fumble with the combos, if you learn his ins and outs, his strengths can tide you through matchups you don't even know about.\nIf you are a seasoned 2D fighting game player who knows how to combo, perhaps Akuma could be the choice for you.\nRecommended Players: Awais Honey, Atif Butt, DaddyKing, K2RO, Eunja",
        "Anna Williams": "lorem",
        "Armor King": "If King represents the glory in the ring, Armor King is the wrestler of the night, the shady alleys, and vigilante justice.\nIf you are a King player, Armor King's gameplan would make sense to you - wavedash in, poke with your lows, if the opponent whiffs, you launch.\nOf course, you shouldn't forget to mix in a healthy dose of chain grabs.\nUnfortunately, Armor King is slightly more execution heavy then King, as his main tool to whiff punish requires a fnddf command.",
        "Asuka Kazama": "lorem",
        "Bob (Robert Richards)": "lorem",
        "Bryan Fury": "A former interpol colleague of Lei Wulong, Bryan was killed in a shootout and reanimated into a cyborg zombie by Dr. Abel.\nWhile Bryan is pure chaotic evil, in online play he is a very \"honest\" character that doesn't have many gimmicks or wonky moves.\nAs a result, he may be a difficult character for a beginner to rank up with, and is not seen often in TWT.\nHowever, he doesn't have a demanding execution barrier and boasts a simple, counterhit focused gameplan.\nThat combined with his cool moves and hit effects make Bryan a very popular secondary character.\nBryan plays using his safe, poking mixups, and takes advantage of the opponent's risky plays with his counterhit moves.\nOne must keep in mind that the true strength of Bryan comes from a stable defense.\nRecommended Players: Knee, JimmyJTran, Bilal, YSEMulti",
        "Claudio Serafino": "As the leader of the Archers of Sirius, Claudio is the world's best exorcist out to cleanse the Devil Gene.\nClaudio has a unique gameplan made possible thanks to his alpha and omega - Noble Step (Burn Knuckle)\nIt is hard to dodge, with a fast startup, high guardback, and plus frames on block. It's only downside is that it is a high.\nNoble Step enables Claudio to have a unique mid/high mixup, as opposed to most characters' mid/low mixups.\nThe current Claudio meta is to pressure the opponent to the wall with Noble Step, then rack up damage with ss4 and df3,2, both low risk moves.\nClaudio's long hopkick reach also gives him the edge in whiff-punishing, but he does struggle in close combat and catching up from a health deficit due to his lack of fast, damaging lows and evasive moves.\nDespite his flaws, he is still a character considered high tier that may be worth considering if you want to start learning.\nRecommended players: Mulgold, Breadman, Shadow20z",
        "Devil Jin": "The youngest Mishima letting his edginess seep out, Devil Jin is Jin Kazama's form when consumed by the Devil Gene.\nUnlike his Kazama counterpart, Devil Jin plays more like the traditional Mishima bloodline - including the difficulty.\nMishimas are commonly considered the hardest characters to play in Tekken - although Akuma still reigns supreme.\nAs such, Devil Jin is not recommended for beginning players, since you need to learn sophisticated commands in addition to learning Tekken.\nDifficulty aside, Devil Jin has amazing moves including, of course, the newly buffed EWGF.\nHis strong mids and lows complementing it gives Devil Jin a higher comeback rate.\nAs such, Devil Jin places higher than average in most metas, and a common top tier pick in tournaments.\nRecommended Players: Knee, Qudans, Saint, Choksae, Soyongdori",
        "Eddy Gordo": "The Brazillian capoeira fighter has a bone to pick with Kazuya Mishima over the murder of his parents.\nIf you are a new fighting game player, you can have fun with Eddy's moveset, robbing people of wins through his evasive stances and easy mixup opportunities.\nEddy's backdash is one of the best in the game, but he compensates by having a abyssmal sidestep - his biggest flaw and a reason his tier drops as the ranks go higher.\nWhile he is truly a unique character that will have you stand out from the crowd, it also means that if you start playing with Eddy, you have to re-learn some parts of Tekken for other characters.\nOf course, if you are looking to get started and just enjoy the game, this shouldn't be a problem for you.\nBut, if you are looking to play Tekken seriously, it is hard to recommend Eddy as his limits are very clear in the highest competitions.\nRecommended Players: JeonDding, Abel del Maestro",
        "Fahkumram": "Maybe you've heard? There's a new Muai Thai fighter in town, and he's not Bruce.\nControlled by a mysterious military corporation with his family held hostage, the legendary Muay Thai champion Fahkumram enters the Iron Fist Tournament under their orders to infiltrate the Mishima Zaibatsu.\nFahkumram has been a hot potato of the Tekken community since his debut, with his great safe mid options and wonky hitboxes boosting him to the top of the tier charts.\nRegardless of what people may say, it is undeniable that Fahkumram looks great, and is easy to get into.\nHis design allows for easy spacing and mixups - but unlike traditional mixups, Fahkumram's revolves around string cancelling and hold commands.\nAs a new player to Tekken, there may be some confusion getting adjusted to his combos.\nDon't look down on it however, his pokes easily add up and counterhits lead to high damage.\nHowever, as a Muay Thai fighter, his moves are very intuitive and his long limbs give him great spacing - if you are looking to learn Tekken more seriously, Fahkumram is definitely a great character to start with.\nRecommended Players: Knee, JDCR, Ulsan, LowHigh, DaddyKing",
        "Feng Wei": "Feng Wei only desires power and fighting, making him a merciless but skilled martial artist.\nFeng Wei has a variety of pokes and supporting stances - combined with his auto parry, Feng lets you focus on crafting your perfect aggression.\nMany of Feng's moves have built in defense, so it covers the potential blind spots you may have during your offense that would have been exploitable for any other character.\nTherefore, he excels in the conservative neutral game but lacks in combo damage. A silver lining would be that his launchers aren't that good anyway, so you wouldn't be looking for combos in the first place.\nUnfortunately, this does knock him down a few pegs tier-wise with the current high-combo damage meta.\nEven so, Feng Wei's strong, tracking, basic attacks will let you inflict damage on the most defensive of foes.\nFeng Wei does have great stances, but you don't need to rely on them to play the character well.\nOverall, if you are trying out a fighting game for the first time, Feng Wei could be a good choice thanks to his moves handling both offense and defense for you.\nRecommended Players: Yuu, Nishi, Kswdang, TeJJ, Hao",
        "Gigas": "Newly introduced in Tekken 7, Gigas is the adoptive father of Katarina who was captured by G-Corporation and turned into a biotech mutation to rival Jack-7.\nGigas has one of the highest range of the cast, letting him play an 'offensive defense' through his long keepaway jabs.\nGigas' versatile jab can counterhit characters trying to close the distance, and is combined with a useful array of WR(while running) moves that can quickly close the gap.\nHis long range means he also has a great whiff punishing ability.\nHowever, Gigas is considered a low tier character in high ranks due to his bad movement, big hitbox, and unsafe frames on key moves.\nBecause of that, I'm sure some people might disagree when I say that Gigas is a 'beginner friendly' character, but he does have an undeniably great range, simple gameplan and execution that complements his pros, and the added benefit of not needing complicated movement.\nOf course, play him at your own risk - he does have clear, exploitable faults that might frustrate you later down the road.\nRecommended Players: Dotoring, Youjin Boy, DaddyKing, Why",
        "Geese Howards": "Introduced as a KoF crossover, Geese brings his rappuken, power gauge, and the famed Howard Estate to Tekken 7.\nWhile he doesn't have a big, unseeable low like a hellsweep, he does meet the requirements for a potential, well rounded character, and there are many hacks to execute his difficult combos.\nHe has faced nerfs in S2, but still remains a viable pick in tournaments.\nGeese has explosive combo damage and strong movesets amplified by his power gauge, letting him comeback from a huge health deficit.\nWhile challenging, he can output consistent combos through practice (as opposed to Akuma), so if you are coming from a 2D fighting game, Geese could be a great way to learn Tekken.\nRecommended Players: Knee, Meo-Il, Destiny, SunChip",
        "Ganryu": "A former esteemed sumo wrestler, Ganryu enters the King of Iron Fist Tournament to prove his worth as the strongest fighter in the world.\nGanryu returns in Tekken 7 as Julia's no.1 fan, a long unrequitted love that started with her mother, Michelle.\nUnfortunately, Ganryu's lack of online popularity may be synonymous with his reason for constant rejection - unflattering looks.\nLooks aside, Ganryu is an amazing character for new Tekken players thanks to his simple gameplan and easy execution.\nEven completely new players would be able to make some headaway with Ganryu by just using his d/f+3, d/f+2, and b2,1.\nHis stable aggression and low risk pokes will add up over time, especially with his decent damaging combos.\nGanryu will be a great companion for both casual starting players, and players who are looking to start learning Tekken seriously, with the only drawback being a small playerbase.\nRecommended Players: Saint",
        "Heihachi Mishima": "The Zeus of Tekken, the leader of Mishima Zaibatsu is also the origin for every major character and the cause of every shitty event in Tekken.\nHe's a Mishima, but in the entry level, he doesn't necessarily need the difficult Mishima commands.\nHis strong mid options allow him to hold his own in neutral situations even without EWGF, and even has mixups with simple commands.\nBecause of his simple execution in mixups, if you are a player trying to learn Mishimas, Heihachi would be a great start.\nDo keep in mind, however, that as you rank up, you will start requiring the traditional Mishima skills. If you haven't improved sufficiently by then, you will reach a serious dilemma.\nRecommended Players: JDCR, Knee, Choksae",
        "Hwoarang": "Hailing from South Korea, Hwoarang constantly strives to become better his skills and ultimately defeat Jin Kazama, his long-standing rival.\nHwoarang is a character who can suffocate the opponent through his free-flowing aggression, trapping them in an endless vortex of punches and kicks.\nOpponents who can't escape this pressure will inevitably find themselves up in the air after getting hit by a just frame skyrocket.\nFunnily enough, Hwoarang also has great grappling options, which don't make him a grappler, but supplements his mixups and potentially setting up a base for his Okizeme.\nHwoarang offers great versatility in his combos and offense, but his moves and stances leave him vulnerable to sidesteps and well-telegraphed counters.\nBecause of his high risk, high reward moveset, Hwoarang players must know when to pause and resume aggression on the fly, sometimes even in the middle of a mixup.\nDue to his multiple stances and associated execution and gameplan difficulty, Hwoarang is not recommended to newer players.\nHowever, if you enjoy flashy, high damage combos and smooth, flowing aggression, Hwoarang might prove to be worth grinding your life into.\nRecommended players: Yeonarang, TKMuse, Rest, Knee, MacRoya",
        "Jack - 7": "He's a brute force killing machine! Jack returns stronger every Tekken series thanks to the faithful Dr. Jane of G Corp.\nJack is a very solidly built character that can go far with simple execution and gameplay. His long uppercut reach and low risk moves let him build up a lead safely.\nJack also has a very good throw game with a command grab for every occasion.\nHis hitbox also gives you the advantage as you backdash away, and combined with your long range, whiff punishing will never be easier.\nDo note that Jack’s neutral jab is 11F (1 frame slower than most), lacks a hopkick, and has a harder time sidestepping.\nJack is a very versatile character that has tools for almost every situation.\nWhile weaker compared to the season 1 days where he was a staple in every tournament, Jack-7 is still a solid, mid tier character that you can see in TWT.\nWith his lower execution barrier and versatile toolkit, he is a great character to start with.\n If you are looking for a character that excels in any situation, one that can adapt to you as your playstyle changes, look no further than the trusty Jack-7.\nRecommended players: Anakin, Saint, Noroma, Casiel",
        "Jin Kazama": "Jin Kazama is the son of Kazuya Mishima and the main protagonist of the Tekken series, aiming to end the Mishima Bloodline once and for all.\nJin is a very solid, versatile character that feels like the embodiment of all Tekken values.\nWhile his moveset gives him versatility everywhere, his defense is accentuated thanks to his amazing parry.\nLater, once one learns EWHF, Jin can also be played extremely aggressively, becoming almost oppressive with his F+4 counterhits and EWHF whiff punishes.\nWhile not exactly a Mishima, if you are looking to steadily improve on your Mishima skills, Jin is probably the best choice.\nRecommended players: CherryBerryMango, Knee, Book",
        "Julia Chang": "Julia is a Native American environmental activist turned streamer, fighting to bring awareness to the dying forests.\n Julia Chang boasts one of the best forward movement in the game thanks to party crasher and swift step.\nUnfortunately, she has a very mediocre sidestep, one of the worst among the female characters.\nShe can use those aggressive lunges to herd the opponent to the wall, where they will be forced to deal with Julia's seemingly never-ending low/mid mixups.\nJulia benefits from an agressive okizeme playstyle, where she has strong 50/50 options both while standing and sitting.\nJulia is also a superior grappler with Mad Axe, one of the fastest throws in the game, and has high damaging combos with great wall carry.\nAll these together have Julia as a top tier character that is seen frequently in high level tournaments.\nUnfortunately, Julia has an intermediate execution hurdle in order to use her highest damage combos that may seem daunting to a newcomer.\nJulia is a character that can improve with you, as your execution grows stronger and her combo damage jumps, you can progress with this character to new heights.\nRecommended players: HelpMe, Chanel, Rangchu, JeonDding, MaD",
        "Kazuya Mishima": "Kazuya is the primary antagonist of the Tekken series, looking to exact revenge on his father Heihachi through his Devil Gene powers.\nKazuya benefits strongly from aggressively pursuing an okizeme through his hellsweep and lion slayer.\nSome players thrive on this scenario and set up aggressive vortexes that is almost impossible to get out of.\nHowever, since his hellsweep can get heavily punished upon block, his aggression comes at a high risk.\nBecause of the risks involved, some players enjoy taking Kazuya more defensively, using movement to whiff punish/counterhit the opponent's attack with a meaty EWGF.\nWhile Kazuya's versatility and cool moves make him a popular choice, Kazuya has one of the highest execution barriers in Tekken and therefore discouraged to new players.\nHowever, if you want a versatile Mishima strengthened with mixups, Kazuya would be the one for you.\nRecommended players: Knee, Choksae, Ryan Hart, BoaLuv, Ikari",
        "Katarina Alvez": "Katarina is a newcomer in Tekken 7, entering the Iron Fist Tournament for money to find her missing adoptive father.\nDespite being from Brazil, Katarina uses Savate, a French kickboxing style of combat.\nTrue to her combat style, Katarina’s emphasis comes from her amazing foot strings that she can cancel out of into harrier stance.\nHer fast counterhit moves and long legs give her the edge over many characters in aggressive, close combat as well as the more defensive neutral position.\nHowever, many of her good lows are slow and risky, and her harrier stance is extremely vulnerable to sidestep right. Her nerf also shortened her hopkick range considerably.\nDue to this, not many people play Katarina on a professional level after her S2 nerfs.\nNonetheless, Katarina’s easy, powerful combos and simple but effective playstyle continues to make her a very solid choice for beginning players who want see how Tekken works.\nRecommended players: Mokujun, Rangchu, Knee, Ghirlanda",
        "Kazumi Hachijo Mishima": "As the member of the Hachijo Clan, Kazumi served as a monitor of the Mishima Zaibatsu, eventually attempting to assassinate Heihachi when his ambitions were deemed too dangerous.\nIn game, Kazumi's offense is low risk and intuitive, automatically raising her defensive capabilities as well.\nThe fact that she has amazing fast pokes mean that if the Kazumi player knows not to overextend, the opponent will not be able to find an opening for their own offense.\nWhile it is not feasible for Kazumi to play the game soley through mixups, her stance does open options for risky 50/50s. Kazumi has versatile options from offense that stems from her amazing pokes.\nWhile nerfed since season 1, Kazumi is still a top tier character that you will see in tournaments often.\nKazumi's amazing neutral makes her beginner friendly, and her moveset encompasses many of the core Tekken concepts that are important to understand.\nAs such, Kazumi is a great starting character with both casual and more serious players in mind.\nIf you are wondering which character to learn first, you can never go wrong with Kazumi.\nRecommended Players: Ulsan, Arslan Ash, Gura",
        "King": "The current King is a luchador from Mexico who was under care of the first, original King's orphanage when he was young.\nNow fully grown, King II continues the original King's legacy as both a formidable wrestler and orphanage owner.\nKing has decent... everything, giving him a versatile playstyle, but he stands out the most via his aggressive mixups into grabs.\nKing's mixup is two-layered. The first layer is whether his offense will be a strike or a grab. Especially in the lower ranks, grabs act almost like a low, forcing the opponent to keep ducking, opening him up to your mids.\nOnce the grabs start landing, the mindgames go to the next step - which chain grab sequence will King execute?\nFrom a beginner's standpoint, King has a bit of a learning curve trying to learn all the chain grab commands, but it does mean he has a variety of reliable setups.\nKing shines when his setups connect into successful grabs, forcing the opponent to continue to make choices with no risk to King himself.\nWhile not the worst character for beginning players, new players may be overwhelmed trying to learn his setups, and end up getting a few unhealthy habits.\nRecommended players: Puma, Lil Majin, Hakaioh, TaiHeiYo, MBC",

        "Steve Fox": "A genius boxer from England, Steve brings a unique gameplan to the table.\nSteve doesn't have the traditional 15 frame launcher, and as a boxer, he only uses his fists to attack. His kick inputs are used to weaving and ducking in stance, giving him an evasive edge.\nAs such, he relies on his great frame punishes and counterhits to rack up damage. This leads to Steve having quite a challenging gameplay where he ideally must know the frame data for many characters\nbut Steve's amazing quick hook and d/f+2 duck in cancel more than makes up for this in the highest level of gameplay.\nSteve players who look to maximize damage also struggle with a high execution barrier involving multiple stance cancels into complex commands.\nHowever, once you get used to his difficult commands, Steve becomes a highly versatile character that you can play any way you want to.\nWhile not recommended for beginners, if you are an accomplished player looking for a challenge, the boxer will probably give you more than enough.\nRecommended players: Knee, Heera, Gura, Lowhigh, FightSpirit",
        "Ling Xiaoyu": "Ling Xiaoyu is a high schooler dreaming of building her own amusement park one day.\nHer whereabouts are currently unknown since she left home to find her missing friend, Jin Kazama.\nXiaoyu is a setup heavy, stance reliant character whose true potential comes from her evasion in Phoenix stance and back-turn mixups.\nHer phoenix stance puts her close to the ground, giving the perfect chance to counterhit over-eager opponents who throw out moves at the slightest frame advantage.\nThe amazing evasion in phoenix stance also gives Xiaoyu an edge over most characters in close combat.\nTo compensate, many of Xiaoyu’s neutral options are shorter in range, making it hard to actually get into range to start her dangerous mixups.\nIn the current professional meta, characters with longer range take priority, categorizing Xiaoyu as a mid tier.\nWhile Xiaoyu doesn’t have particularly hard execution, her playstyle relying heavily on stance based combat makes her unrecommended for beginners.\nHowever, if you enjoy the aggressive, in your face gamestyle, and take pride in being able to get close enough to land those mixups, you'll have fun with our Princess Ling.\nRecommended players: Sodam, P.Ling, Tanukana, Yuyu, Wecka"
