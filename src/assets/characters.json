            "flavortext-eng": "Alisa is a robot created by Dr. Bosconovitch to look like his daughter, designed to serve as bodyguard of Jin Kazama.\nAlong with Lars and Lee, Alisa is shown in Tekken 7 supporting Jin as he prepares to defeat the invading Kazuya Mishima.\nOne of Alisa's biggest characteristic is her movement. Her quick backdashes and sidesteps allow her to push the limits of Tekken,\ndodging moves in situations that other characters would not be able to dodge.\nThis enables Alisa to poke and prod the opponent with her safer moves, then whiff punish the opponent as soon as they throw out a move without thinking.\nAlisa's neutral moves and optimal combos are very easy to execute, making her a good character to start with.\nHowever, Alisa does have slightly lower punish damage as well as limited combo routes to compensate.\nIf you want to enjoy Tekken's 3D fighting mechanics to the fullest, Alisa would be a great choice for you.\nAlisa's potential grows as you learn more about the game and learn how to utilize movement and sidesteps effectively.\nRecommended players: Chanel, AO, Cuddle Core",
