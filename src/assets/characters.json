            "flavortext-eng": "Alisa is a robot created by Dr. Bosconovitch to look like his daughter, designed to serve as bodyguard of Jin Kazama.\nAlong with Lars and Lee, Alisa is shown in Tekken 7 supporting Jin as he prepares to defeat the invading Kazuya Mishima.\nOne of Alisa's biggest characteristic is her movement. Her quick backdashes and sidesteps allow her to push the limits of Tekken,\ndodging moves in situations that other characters would not be able to dodge.\nThis enables Alisa to poke and prod the opponent with her safer moves, then whiff punish the opponent as soon as they throw out a move without thinking.\nAlisa's neutral moves and optimal combos are very easy to execute, making her a good character to start with.\nHowever, Alisa does have slightly lower punish damage as well as limited combo routes to compensate.\nIf you want to enjoy Tekken's 3D fighting mechanics to the fullest, Alisa would be a great choice for you.\nAlisa's potential grows as you learn more about the game and learn how to utilize movement and sidesteps effectively.\nRecommended players: Chanel, AO, Cuddle Core",

A silver lining would be that his launchers aren't that good anyway, so you wouldn't be looking for combos in the first place.\nUnfortunately, this does knock him down a few pegs tier-wise with the current high-combo damage meta.\nEven so, Feng Wei's strong, tracking, basic attacks will let you inflict damage on the most defensive of foes.\nFeng Wei does have great stances, but you don't need to rely on them to play the character well.\nOverall, if you are trying out a fighting game for the first time, Feng Wei could be a good choice thanks to his moves handling both offense and defense for you.\nRecommended Players: Yuu, Nishi, Kswdang, TeJJ, Hao",
